Sophos Quick Change ISP Checklist
1️⃣ Plug & Identify
WAN cable from new ISP → into the same WAN port on Sophos that the old ISP used (or note the new port if it’s different).

In Web Admin → Network → Interfaces, find the interface that shows Disconnected for the old ISP.

2️⃣ Edit WAN Interface
Go to: Network → Interfaces → Edit WAN port

IP Assignment: Select what your ISP uses:

DHCP — Most ISPs (auto IP from ISP modem/router)

Static — Enter IP, Subnet, Gateway given by ISP

PPPoE — Enter username/password from ISP

Gateway: Make sure the correct gateway IP is filled.

Save.

3️⃣ Set as Default Gateway
Go to: Routing → Gateways

Ensure the new WAN gateway is:

Status: Green/Active

Default Gateway: ✅ Checked

Disable the old WAN gateway.

4️⃣ NAT Rule Check
Go to: Rules & Policies → NAT Rules

Find your LAN → WAN masquerade rule.

Under Outgoing Interface, replace the old WAN interface with your new WAN interface.

Save.

5️⃣ DNS Settings
Go to: Network → DNS

Add:

Copy
Edit
8.8.8.8
1.1.1.1
(or your ISP DNS if provided)

Save.

6️⃣ Test from Sophos
Go to: Diagnostics → Tools

Ping 8.8.8.8 from the new WAN interface → should succeed.

Ping google.com → if this works, DNS is fine.

7️⃣ LAN Side
No change needed — your LAN stays 192.168.0.x.

All devices should still get IPs in that range from Sophos.
